### Requirements.

- Node
- Yarn

This is a node application the utilises React in the front end.
The back end is Node and the front end is React.

To run the application, clone it and cd into the server directory.

- Inside the server directory, in the app.js file, replace the database
  name and password with your own. You can find the database schema in
  models directory.

- I recommend using MLab for the databsae. Head over to https://mlab.com/ and create a DB there. Everything is free there... Dont be scared :grinning:

- Run `yarn install`
- Then run `nodemon app` to start the node server.

- cd into the client directory, in another tetminal window.
- Run `yarn install`
- Then run `yarn start` to start the front end app.
- You can visit the online Frontend application at https://books-34c80.firebaseapp.com
